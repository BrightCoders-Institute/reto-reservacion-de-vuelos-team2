## üíª Description of project
The project consists of developing a mobile application for ABC Corp, which will allow customers to easily and conveniently register their flight reservations. The application will be available for both iOS and Android devices.

To store the information of registered users and flight reservations, the application will use Firebase as the database. Users will have the option to register using their name, email, and password, or through their Google account. Once registered, they can log in to the application using their credentials.

Once users have logged in, they will be able to access a list of their flight reservations retrieved from Firebase. Additionally, they will have the ability to add new reservations by providing flight details such as origin, destination, date, and number of passengers. All this information will be saved in Firebase for future reference.
